# eindproject_fs_ba_2022
Final project for my full stack bootcamp course
This project idea comes from my love for trail running. I like to search for new routes to run and I think it would be nice if there was one single place where you could search or discover new routes.
My goal was to create a login system and a search page besides a front page.
